### Introduction 

Use this *markdown* template to write pager or small reports for communication at <https://www.fineprint.global/>. In the FINEPRINT briefs use only level three headings, i.e., from `###`. The briefs are small documents that do not require more levels. Other levels are reserved to HTML headings. 

### Body 

### Adding references 

Reference metadata must be in the *BibTeX* file `references.bib`. You can export this metadata from Citavi to *BibTeX* or directly download it from journal's web pages or Google Scholar. To include the reference in the text type `@<bibtex_key>`, e.g.:

- Typing `@Bruckner:2012` results in @Bruckner:2012 

- Typing `[@Bruckner:2012; @Giljum:2004]` results in [@Bruckner:2012; @Giljum:2004]

### External figures 

Non-R figures should be added to the folder `img`. For details on how to add figures to the text click [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html).

### Data input 

If the input data is not too large, they can be added to the folder `input`. For more massive input datasets, please include R commands to download the data from our infrastructure <http://fineprint.wu.ac.at/ckan>. 

### Data output 

Intermediate datasets, if required, should be added to the folder `output`.
